## Concept
Our concept is an attractive, modern web app for finding and staying up to date with local farms
and their CSAs, farm stands, and farmers market appearances. Unlike the offerings that exist today,
Farmly's back-end would crawl the web and public sources for information on local farms, CSAs, etc.,
and reach out to those farmers through email, social media, or by phone, to invite them to participate.
With a short questionnaire, each farm could have a rich, attractive presentation, without a lot of effort.
Farmly would also integrate a social networking component, allowing users to sign up for updates on
different farms' local activities.

## Business Model
Unlike other social media platforms, each user's and farmer's content would belong to them. As a public
benefit nonprofit corporation, Farmly would guarantee that its users information was never used without
consent. Farmers markets, CSAs, and other local profit-making centers would provide income to supplement
volunteer efforts, in return for increased exposure and customer bases.
